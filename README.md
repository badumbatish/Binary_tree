# BINARY SEARCH TREE OVERVIEW
__Binary Search Tree__ (Bin_tree) is a library that I write for fun (and for educational purpose). 
The library complies with the RAII memory management technique.
Uses raw pointers instead of smart pointers. 

## Q&A
-  __Is your code a different style from geeksforgeeks or any other programming blogs ?__
	I haven't checked anything else but geeksforgeeks but I'm sure I'm different from the blog.
	I follow a more modern C++ style than geeksforgeeks's style and this repository includes not only the code, various test cases for the library but also wikipedia pages for each member functions and explanation for each of them.
- __How is it performance-wise?__
Right now there's no benchmark and I don't write the library in search for performance. The repository is more focused on the analytics of why I write the library the way I write and why I use certain stuff to make the library works.
- __Why write the library?__
For fun, for educational purpose and to improve myself.
Other learner can comment on the repo and learn a thing or twice i think.
